### Story one 

```text
Story one took long. I tried to model the database based on the information I had. I am still not sure if the database 
I modelled is accurate. I then dockerised the app and using docker-compose to run the services together. Wrote the test cases
to check the config and planning to use monkeypatching for the remaining ones.

I configured the setup.cfg basically asking the Flake8 to stick to some rules and coveragerc to omit the app/tests folder
and set the branching to true to check if the conditions in the if/else is correct.

I wrote unit tests for the configuration and a test for the endpoint to make sure the project is working. Which is a test api


I declared a method which is calc test and it returns nothing
